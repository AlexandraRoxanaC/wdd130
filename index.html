            <p>Hi. My name is Alexandra, but many friends call me Ale. I am married for 9 years, but no children yet.
                We live in Sibiu Romania. It is a beautiful city that is visited by many people. In my free time I 
                like to read, cook and bake, and taking long walks. I enjoy finding new recipes and try them out.</p>

            <p>Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central and Southeastern Europe. It has a coastline 
                on the Black Sea and borders Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Serbia, and Ukraine. Romania has mountain 
                ranges running from the north and west in the interior, which are collectively known as the 
                Carpathians.</p>
